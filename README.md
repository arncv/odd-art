# ODD ART

## What it does
       Odd Art develops mini-squares and fills them with different shapes (algorithmically). It then connects them all together in a visual array placed on a single image to create the final art piece.
## How we built it
       Odd Art was created with python, tkinter, pycario and Tcl themes.
## Challenges we ran into
      On the GUI input side, there were many challenges with properly spacing out widgets and creating them with the constraints of Tkinter. 
## What we learned
       Learned tkinter,pycario & tcl themes
## What's next for Odd Art
      Integrating Twilio to send the photos generated through WhatsApp & hosting it on the cloud .
