# ODD ART

## What it does
       Odd Art develops mini-squares and fills them with different shapes (algorithmically). It then connects them all together in a visual array placed on a single image to create the final art piece.
## How we built it
       Odd Art was created with python, tkinter, pycario and Tcl themes.
## Challenges we ran into
      On the GUI input side, there were many challenges with properly spacing out widgets and creating them with the constraints of Tkinter. 
## What we learned
       Learned tkinter,pycario & tcl themes
## What's next for Odd Art
      Integrating Twilio to send the photos generated through WhatsApp & hosting it on the cloud .
## Installation:

```pip install pycairo```

```pip install --upgrade Pillow```

## Having an Error With Installation?:
When installing the program by downloading the files as zip and extracting the folder you may encounter an error when running. If you do, it is probably because of an issue with Tcl themes that were used in the project. To solve this, go to https://github.com/rdbende/Sun-Valley-ttk-theme. Then download the contents of this repository as a zip, and paste the contents of the unzipped folder into the folder for this project. It should work after that.
